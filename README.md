# WPM (Wave propagation in a megaphone)
This is a project done in the Acoustics course LU3ME105 at Sorbonne Universit√©. We have studied the propagation of waves in a megaphone.

In order to do this, we chose two types of megaphones, one that has a liniar surface variation and one that has an exponential surface variation. Our results and manipulations can be found in the WPM.pdf file.
